#Project Description
The most common problem while booking tickets for monuments or museums is the waiting time or the chaos that is created in front of the ticket window.
Also, a lot of paper is wasted in generating those tickets which totally goes to waste after the use.
TicketBari.com generates a QR based e-ticket that eleminates all these problems while also providing features such as ease in bookings, seamless user experience and faster management of entries/exits.
It also helps maintain a proper record of all the tourists/visitors.

The system starts with the user visiting TicketBari.com which provides details of some famous monuments/museums in India. The user can also find information about some of the evenst that are going to take place in these places.
For booking tickets, the user can navigate to Plan Your Visit section and then select the city for visit.
After selecting the city, the user will have to select the place i.e. the monument or museum of visit.
After location selection, the user will be entering the his/her details, date and time of visit, number of tickets, etc.
Finally the user will be redirected to the payment gateway and after the successfull payment transaction, the user will receive his/her ticket QR code.
